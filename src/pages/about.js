        <p>And that was the aha moment for our founder & CEO, Shihab Mohammed. The third reminder to fill out his HR survey made him think, “Why do we not like surveys?” That was the beginning of everything. Shihab, & the initial team started putting together a feedback tool that can take away the ‘boring’ out of surveys. The Whatsapp’s chat interface inspired him to keep the forms as conversational and intuitive as possible, guaranteeing 40% more response rates. And thus, SurveySparrow was born introducing the world’s first chat surveys. Since then, SurveySparrow has now grown from a feedback tool to a complete omnichannel experience platform. The platform has extended and is continuously improving every aspect of it to deliver nothing but wows.</p>
